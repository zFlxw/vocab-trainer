# 📘 Vocab-Trainer
Have you ever felt like learning vocabs can be boring, especially if you do not want to just sit behind a book? Then **Vocab-Trainer** is the perfect solution for you. You can easily add groups of vocabs, called *Decks*, for instance if you want to keep multiple languages or topics sorted together. 

But keep in mind, this is just a fun project of mine, and also kind of my first web development project ever. So the code might not be professional, please educate me about mistakes you found. :) 

## ❓ Why to choose **Vocab-Trainer**?
First of all, it is completely **free** to use. No ads, no features blocked behind paywalls. Also, here is a brief list of my most important features (if the checkbox is not ticked, the feature is still in development and will be added later):

- [ ] A list of your personal Decks.
- [ ] A community area, where you can share Decks to other users.
- [ ] A learning and editing section.

## 💵 Whats the 'business model' behind **Vocab-Trainer**?
Actually, there is non. As I said, **Vocab-Trainer** is just a fun project of mine to gain experience in web development. Also, as nearly every of my projects, the idea came to me, because I searched for such a project and I wanted to implement it by myself. 

## 💻 Is there an option to contribute to **Vocab-Trainer**?
Hell yeah, please, feel free to contribute to this project, especially if there are (security) issues. I do not have much experience in web development, so every kind of help is welcome. For instructions, please consider reading the README in the appropriate subfolder (client and server).
